## 🔧 **Projects I've Worked On**

Here are some of the exciting projects I've worked on:

### 1. **[Fashion-MNIST-Classification](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/Fashion-MNIST-Classification)**  
A PyTorch-based classification project using three models:  
- **ANN with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning**  
- **Custom CNN**  
- **VGG16 pretrained model**  
  _Result: VGG16 achieved the highest accuracy among them._

### 2. **[Weather-Forecast-Web-App](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/Weather-Forecast-Web-App)**  
A **weather forecast app** built using **Streamlit** and **OpenWeatherMap API** to display real-time weather data for any city.

### 3. **[K-Means-Image-Compression](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/K-Means-Image-Compression)**  
This project leverages the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to compress images by reducing the number of unique colors, optimizing image storage.

### 4. **[Excel-to-PDF-InvoiceCreator](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/Excel-to-PDF-InvoiceCreator)**  
Generates a **PDF invoice from an Excel file**, integrating libraries like **pathlib**, **pandas**, **glob**, and **fpdf** for a smooth workflow.

### 5. **[NewsAPI-email](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/NewsAPI-email)**  
Fetches **news** from the internet using **NewsAPI** and sends it via **email** with **smtplib** and **ssl** for secure transmission.

### 6. **[To-Do-List-app](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/To-Do-List-app)**  
A simple yet effective **To-Do List app** created with **FreeSimpleGUI** in Python, enabling users to add, edit, and complete tasks easily.
