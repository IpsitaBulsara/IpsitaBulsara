## 🔧 **Projects I've Worked On**

Here are some of the exciting projects I've built and contributed to:

### 1. [**Fashion-MNIST-Classification**](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/Fashion-MNIST-Classification)  
A PyTorch-based project exploring Fashion MNIST classification using:
- ANN with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning  
- Custom CNN  
- Pretrained VGG16  
📊 *VGG16 achieved the highest accuracy.*

### 2. [**Weather-Forecast-Web-App**](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/Weather-Forecast-Web-App)  
A Streamlit-based app that fetches and displays real-time weather for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

### 3. [**K-Means-Image-Compression**](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/K-Means-Image-Compression)  
Compresses images by clustering similar pixel colors using the K-Means algorithm — a fun and visual project!

### 4. [**Excel-to-PDF-InvoiceCreator**](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/Excel-to-PDF-InvoiceCreator)  
Automatically converts Excel-based invoice data into PDFs using Pandas, FPDF, and file handling libraries.

### 5. [**NewsAPI-email**](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/NewsAPI-email)  
Fetches top headlines via NewsAPI and sends them through email using Python’s `smtplib` and secure protocols.

### 6. [**To-Do-List-app**](https://github.com/IpsitaBulsara/To-Do-List-app)  
A minimalist task management app built with FreeSimpleGUI to help manage your daily to-dos efficiently.
